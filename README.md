Youtube music tracker is a small and powerful app to track the music we listen to from youtube music while we stream.

# Instructions

2) Create an API account [LastFM-API](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create)

3) Run the Account Manager App.
4) Enter your username in the text box and press the check button (It must be exactly the same as it appears in [LastFM](https://www.last.fm/es/)).
5) Copy the directory of the index.html in a browser type source in OBS.
### Enjoy!

### Note

**If you detect any problem with the program or have comments about it, you can let me know in the [issues](https://github.com/NIghtDarkness/Music_Tracker/issues) section or send me an email here (temporarily disabled).**


**Pro Tip: if you install an [Apache Server](https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi) and upload the program you can have a local ip in case you stream with 2 PCs.**
